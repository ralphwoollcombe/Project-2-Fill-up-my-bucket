## App Name  
**Twitcher**

### Description  
This is a full-stack web application that allows users to log, view, and manage wildlife sightings. Users can record details such as species, class, location, date, habitat, country, behaviour, and number of individuals seen.

The app is designed to make wildlife logging intuitive and visually friendly, while maintaining structured data relationships between species, sightings, habitats, and countries.

### Why I Built This App  
I built this app to combine my interest in nature with full-stack development skills. The project focuses on relational data modelling with a focus on many-to-many referenced models, clean form layouts, and readable show pages.
